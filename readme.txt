Smaller Images, Faster Sites, Happier Visitors. Comprehensive image optimization that doesn't require a degree in rocket science.

== Description ==

Are you frustrated by a slow website? Do over-sized images make you say "ewww"... Let EWWW Image Optimizer help you make your site faster, improve your bounce rate, and boost your SEO. But most importantly, make your visitors happier so they keep coming back for more.

With EWWW IO you can optimize all your existing images, [from any plugin](https://docs.ewww.io/article/84-plugin-compatibility), and then let EWWW IO take care of new image uploads automatically.

**Why use EWWW Image Optimizer?**

1. **No Speed Limits** and [unlimited file size](https://ewww.io/unlimited-file-size/).

1. **High Torque** as we bring you the best compression/quality ratio available with our Premium compression for JPG, PNG, and PDF files.
1. **Adaptive Steering** with intelligent conversion options to get the right image format for the job (JPG, PNG, GIF, or WebP).
1. **Metered Parking** means you never pay for an image we can’t compress, you are never billed for a month you do not use the API, and pre-paid credits never expire. Plus, get WebP image generation at no extra cost: any image can be converted to Google’s next-generation image format.

= Automatic Everything =

With Easy IO, images are automatically compressed, scaled to fit the page and device size, lazy loaded, and converted to the next-gen WebP format.

= Bulk Optimize =

Optimize all your images from a single page. This includes the Media Library, your theme, and a handful of pre-configured folders (see Optimize Everything Else below). GRAND FlaGallery, NextCellent and NextGEN have their own Bulk Optimize pages.

= Optimize Everything Else =

Configure any folder within your WordPress install to be optimized. The Bulk Optimizer will compress theme images, BuddyPress avatars, BuddyPress Activity Plus images, Meta Slider slides, WP Symposium Pro avatars, GD bbPress attachments, Grand Media Galleries, and any user-specified folders. You can also use Scheduled optimization or run the optimizer from WP-CLI if that's more your thing.

= Plugin Compatibility =

EWWW IO has been tested with hundreds (if not thousands) of [plugins and themes](https://docs.ewww.io/article/84-plugin-compatibility), here are just a few of the most common ones: BuddyPress (Activity Plus add-on too), Cloudinary, Easy Watermark, FooGallery, GD bbPress Attachments, GRAND FlAGallery, Gmedia Photo Gallery, MediaPress, Meta Slider, Microsoft Azure Storage, MyArcadePlugin, NextGEN Gallery, Regenerate Thumbnails, WP Offload Media, [WPML](https://wpml.org/plugin/ewww-image-optimizer/), WP Retina 2x, WP RSS Aggregator, WP Symposium. [Read more...](https://docs.ewww.io/article/84-plugin-compatibility)

= WebP Images =

If you want simple, get automatic WebP conversion with Easy IO, and be done with it! Otherwise, you can generate WebP versions of your images with the Bulk Optimizer, and deliver them to supported browsers. Take your pick between Apache-style rewrite rules, JS WebP Rewriting, and <picture> WebP Rewriting. EWWW IO even works with the WebP option in the Cache Enabler plugin from KeyCDN.

= WP-CLI =

Allows you to run all Bulk Optimization processes from your command line, instead of the web interface. It is much faster, and allows you to do things like run it in 'screen' or via regular cron (instead of wp-cron, which can be unpredictable on low-traffic sites). Install WP-CLI from wp-cli.org, and run 'wp-cli.phar help ewwwio optimize' for more information or see the [Docs](https://docs.ewww.io/article/25-optimizing-with-wp-cli).

= CDN Support =

[WP Offload Media](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/) is the officially supported (and recommended) plugin for uploads to Amazon S3, Digital Ocean Spaces, and Google Cloud Storage. [Check our compatibility list for details on other plugins](https://docs.ewww.io/article/84-plugin-compatibility). All pull mode CDNs like Cloudflare, KeyCDN, MaxCDN, and Sucuri work automatically, but will require you to purge the cache after a bulk optimization.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Google Pagespeed says my images need compressing or resizing, but I already optimized all my images. What do I do? =

Try this for starters: [https://docs.ewww.io/article/5-pagespeed-says-my-images-need-more-work](https://docs.ewww.io/article/5-pagespeed-says-my-images-need-more-work)

= Does the plugin replace existing images? =

Yes, but only if the optimized version is smaller. The plugin should NEVER create a larger image.
